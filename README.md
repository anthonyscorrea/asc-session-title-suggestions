# Session Title Suggestions for FoundryVTT

## Overview

This FoundryVTT module allows players to suggest titles for the session, similar to how podcast titles are suggested. In my own sessions, I record every session's audio and make it into a podcast. Many of my favorite podcasts use a random, funny, out-of-context quote from the episode for the title. Inspired by this, I created this module so players can suggest titles and the GM can list them all and choose the best one. Players can use the `/title` or `/t` command to suggest a title. A GM or trusted player can use the `/titles` or `/ts` command to get a list of all the suggestions for the most recent day's session.

## Features

- Players can suggest session titles using the `/title`, `/t`, or `t/` command.
- GMs or trusted players can view all suggested titles for the most recent session using the `/titles` or `/ts` command.

## Requirements

This module requires the Chat Commander module to be installed and enabled. You can find it [here](https://gitlab.com/woodentavern/foundryvtt-chat-command-lib).

## Usage
